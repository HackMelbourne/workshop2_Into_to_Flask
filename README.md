# HackMelbourne Flask workshop code snippets
Here is the final main.py which was seen at the end of the workshop held on 28/8/2020.
The actual "ideal" final end product can be seen in the folder "final_product_kinda" as a rough guide on the 3rd task during the workshop.

Feel free to clone this project and build upon it :)

Built using Python3.8 but should work for 3.6+ (probably).

## Requirements:
- Flask
- requests
